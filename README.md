# Neumorphic or Soft UI

### Neumorphism, or soft UI, is a visual style that combines background colors, shapes, gradients, highlights, and shadows to ensure graphic intense buttons and switches. All that allows achieving a soft, extruded plastic look, and almost 3D styling.
### Unlike normal cardview in android, both background and cards holds same color. Cards are elevated and contains bi-color shadows. 
### In light soft ui, Top - Left shadows shows light shadow and Bottom - Right shadows shows little more dark shadow.
